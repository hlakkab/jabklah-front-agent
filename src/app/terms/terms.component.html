                                            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                In an increasingly digital world, where customer data and financial transactions are 
                                                conducted online, ensuring the utmost security and establishing strict conditions for
                                                 our bank website for agents is of paramount importance. This article highlights the 
                                                 key security measures and conditions we have implemented to safeguard sensitive
                                                  information, protect against cyber threats, and maintain regulatory compliance.

                                            <p>
                                            At the forefront of our security measures is a robust authentication system. Agents 
                                            accessing the website are required to employ strong and unique passwords, undergo 
                                            regular password updates, and utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
                                            This multi-layered approach ensures that only authorized individuals can gain access,
                                             significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized breaches.

                                            <h2>3.Data Encryption:</h2>
                                            <p>To safeguard sensitive data, both during transit and at rest, we employ industry-standard 
                                                encryption protocols such as HTTPS. This ensures that all communication between the website and the server is encrypted, 
                                                preventing eavesdropping and data interception. Additionally, we implement strong encryption algorithms to protect stored data,
                                                 rendering it unreadable to unauthorized individuals.</p>

                                                 Furthermore, we utilize intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and real-time log analysis tools 
                                                 to continuously monitor for potential threats,
